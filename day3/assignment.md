### What is JSX?

JSX is a html like syntax which is used in react to write the structure which is bascially gets rendered into the dom and appears on the user screen.

### Superpowers of JSX

The SuperPower of JSX is that we can write logic and markup of the component inside the single jsx file. Suppose we want to dispaly the no of times a count button has been pressed and immediately update the UI. So in that that case we can pass the variable that holds the count value and as soon as it changes it reflects the dom inside of a html element.
